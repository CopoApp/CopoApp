## 😞 The Problem 
<!-- content goes below -->
For over 12,000 years, pets have been loyal companions to humans—providing emotional support, protection, and even improving physical health. Studies show that pets can buffer stress, lower blood pressure, provide social support, and promote an active lifestyle. In many households, pets are not just animals — they are family.

This reality hit close to home for our team when Jordi, one of our members, lost his beloved dog, Copo, as a child. That personal experience showed how devastating and helpless it can feel when a pet goes missing. Sadly, Jordi’s story is not unique. According to the ASPCA, about 10 million pets are lost every year in the United States, and the majority never reunite with their families.

In urban areas like New York City, the fast‑paced lifestyle, dense population, and limited outdoor spaces amplify the challenge of keeping track of pets. Our team has observed firsthand how difficult it can be for community members to navigate this issue without an effective system in place.

Root causes

- No centralized, city‑wide platform for reporting and recovering lost pets.

- Fragmented, low‑tech solutions (paper flyers, isolated social‑media posts) that fail to reach relevant neighbors quickly.

- Limited public awareness and lack of shared responsibility.

Specific needs our project will focus on

1. A centralized, accessible platform for reporting lost or found pets in real‑time.

2. Fast, location‑based matching system to connect pet owners with finders nearby.

3. Community‑building tools to raise awareness and encourage collective responsibility.

## 📝 Summary
<!-- content goes below -->
Lost pets often go unnoticed, and existing systems lack both visibility and active community involvement. CopoApp is a centralized, user‑friendly web application where anyone can swiftly report a lost or found pet, browse nearby reports, and collaborate with neighbors to bring pets home. Our primary audience is NYC‑area pet owners, animal lovers, local shelters, and good Samaritans. By fostering shared responsibility, we aim to shorten reunion times, increase recovery rates, and strengthen community bonds.

## 🤔 Our Hypothesis
<!-- content goes below -->
Core challenge: The absence of an accessible, trusted, and centralized platform prevents timely reunification of lost pets with their owners.

Unique perspective: Our team combines lived experience of losing a pet, technical skills, and community ties in NYC to design a solution that feels personal, local, and trustworthy.

Role of technology: A lightweight web app image upload, and real‑time notifications can empower residents to crowd‑source searches and dramatically improve reunion outcomes.
